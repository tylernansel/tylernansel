## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a young Data Analyst I take pride in my ability to discover hidden stories in data and clearly communicate them to my peers. I thrive on leveraging data to help businesses make better decisions. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets, building dashboards, or running advanced analytics, I am always excited to tackle new challenges and learn from every project. My background in Data Analytics and Information Systems from Drake University has equipped me with strong analytical skills, and I'm eager to apply them in more real-world scenarios as I continue to grow as a professional. 

I have strong technical skills in R, SAS, Python, Alteryx, MySQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Regression Analysis, Machine Learning and Microsoft Office. Iâ€™ve worked on projects that analyze trends, optimize processes, and provide business-critical insights.

My upbringing, as well as my time as a Division I college football player, pushed me to develop strong soft skills such as time management, communication, critical thinking, attention to detail and adaptability. I understand how to connect with diverse team members and work in a manner that optimizes each individuals strengths and talents. 

I am currently looking for opportunities that will help foster my growth as a Data Analyst. I am open to a variety of roles and industries
